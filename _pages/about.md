# About Me

I am currently in the final year of my BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. Over the course of my degree I have found myself gravitating towards areas of applied statistics - you could call it data science or machine learning or whatever you like. I hope to have a career in this very broad field which means the current next stepping stone for me is a postgraduate degree in some quantitative area.

My undergraduate dissertation is under the supervision of D.K.Arvind, Chair of Distributed Wireless Computation here at Edinburgh. I am working to develop an exposure-response relationship between air pollution and the breathing flow of young asthmatics using a large dataset built over a long period of time, with the hope of developing a predictive model using such a relationship.

A fellow Edinburgh student and I, along with two of our friends from the University of Oxford also enjoy travelling to hackathons all over the country (and sometimes outside of it) with the intention of buildings the most ridiculous yet interesting thing possible. For example one of our projects involved mounting a sawed off electric watergun to a moving platform controlled by a Raspberry Pi and using Microsoft's face recognition API to locate your face and fire water (or any other definitely non-alcoholic drink) directly into your mouth.

I also enjoy fooling around with data and trying my best to keep up with the state of the art in machine learning (although this often feels impossible).

My [CV] includes some more technical info on me.

# About Me


<img src="{{ "/assets/images/hackathon.jpg" | absolute_url }}" width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">

I am currently in the final year of my BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. Over the course of my degree I have found myself gravitating towards areas of applied statistics - you could call it data science or machine learning or whatever you like. I am pursuing a career in this very broad field.

My honours project is under the supervision of Professor D.K. Arvind, Chair of Distributed Wireless Computation here at Edinburgh. I am grateful for the chance to work with some real data in a field I love in a healthcare application: hopefully I can play a small part in making the world a better place! My work is part of the larger "Delhi Air Pollution: Health and Effects (DAPHNE)" project, led by the University of Edinburgh and Professor Arvind. You can read more about the project [here][2].

A fellow Edinburgh student and I, along with two of our good friends from the University of Oxford, enjoy travelling to hackathons all over the country (and sometimes outside of it) with the intention of attempting the most ridiculous yet interesting projects possible. One such project involved mounting a sawed off electric watergun to a moving platform controlled by a Raspberry Pi and using Microsoft's face recognition API to locate your face and fire water (or any other definitely non-alcoholic drink) directly into your mouth. And yes, it did actually work (clearly to the cameraman's delight):

I also enjoy fooling around with data and trying my best to keep up with the state of the art in machine learning (although this often feels impossible).

My [CV][1] includes some more technical info on me.
